These awesome, spicy, charred-up pork tacos are a good fast way to maximum deliciousness.

Prepare your pork using:

chopped pork sriracha marinade

Fry up your spiced chunks of pork over high heat so that they char up real nice.These are best left pretty simple, as the pork itself is the real highlight here. I'd recommend adding:

    chopped tomatoes
    pickled_red_onions

Would also be amazing just straight-up street taco style with chopped raw onion and some salsa verde.
